        <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
        <p>
            Goutham Subramani built the Serene DND (Do Not Disturb) app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Goutham Subramani at no cost and is intended for use as is.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
            policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
            Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
            the collection and use of information in relation to this
            policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
            used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
            anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
            as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
            Serene DND (Do Not Disturb) unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
        <p>
            For a better experience, while using our Service, I
            may require you to provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information, including but not limited to e-mail. The information that
            I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                The app does use third-party services that may collect

        <p>
            I want to inform you that whenever you
            use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
            I collect data and information (through third-party
            products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
            include information such as your device Internet Protocol
            (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
            configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
            the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
            statistics.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
            commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
            to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
            stored on your device\'s internal memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
            the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
            “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
            You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
            and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
            choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
            portions of this Service.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
        <p>
            I may employ third-party companies and
            individuals due to the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I want to inform users of this Service
            that these third parties have access to their Personal
            Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
            them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
            disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>
            I value your trust in providing us your
            Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
            of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
            storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
            guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
        <p>
            This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
            a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
            that these external sites are not operated by me.
            Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
            Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
            no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
            privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
            services.

                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                I do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                me with personal information, I immediately
                delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                personal information, please contact me so that
                I will be able to do the necessary actions.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
